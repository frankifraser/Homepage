  	<h1>about me</h1>

<section>
    <p class="notl">Born in the small town of Niagara On The Lake Ontario, Franki Fraser had a passion for art ever since she could hold a pencil. Her family could sense she had a gift once she started colouring with the other children in her class. She was very particular with the colours she chose and made sure to neatly stay within the lines while all the other children would grab any crayon in sight and scribble all over the page.</p>

</section>

<section>

    <p class="brock">Once Franki could recognize her love for art, her parents signed her up for art classes while she was younger and she followed up in high school taking the visual arts course all four years. After graduating with honours she took the Visual Arts Course at Brock University and decided it was not the school or course for her.</p>

</section>

<section>

    <p class="sheridan">She then took the 1 year Art Fundamentals course at Sheridan College which opened her eyes to the world of digital art. Franki is now in her last year of Graphic Design at Niagara College and will be taking commissions on her Instagram.</p>
